# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** Casa de las Almas (House of Souls)
**Type:** Boutique / Spiritual Retreat
**Star Rating:** 4.2 on booking sites (oddly uniform reviews)
**Price Range:** $45-$80 per night (expensive for the area, justified by "ceremonies")

### History
Built in 1847 as a convent. Decommissioned after a scandal in 1923 involving a nun who "became someone else." Converted to a hotel in 1956, then a hostel in 1998. The current owner, Don Aurelio, is the fourth generation of a family that has served as "intermediaries between souls" since before the convent was built. The ritual has been performed here for over 200 years.

### Architecture
- **Style:** Spanish colonial with indigenous Mayan influences
- **Floors:** 3 plus rooftop terrace
- **Total beds:** 32 (but never at full capacity - some rooms are "reserved")
- **Notable features:** Mirror-lined ritual chamber in the basement, central courtyard with a sealed well (legend says it leads to Xibalba), walls embedded with obsidian shards

```

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
The Ingrid Suite on the third floor - a corner room with terra cotta floors, white stucco walls, a medical-grade bed hidden by colorful blankets, and a view of the courtyard below. The windows are kept sealed to "preserve the energy." A portrait of a young woman hangs on the wall - no one knows it's the original owner of the body Ingrid arrived in. Chelsea dies here, in this room, watching her own body through the window as it loads suitcases into a taxi.

## The City

**City:** Valladolid
**Country:** Mexico (Yucatan Peninsula)
**Population:** ~50,000
**Known for:** Colonial architecture, cenotes, gateway to Chichen Itza, well-preserved Mayan culture

### Geography
- **Climate:** Tropical, hot and humid year-round
- **Terrain:** Flat limestone plain, numerous cenotes (natural sinkholes)
- **Weather during story:** Dry season, intense sun, occasional evening thunderstorms

### Culture
- **Language(s):** Spanish, Yucatec Maya still spoken
- **Religion(s):** Catholic majority with syncretized Mayan beliefs
- **Customs relevant to story:** Strong belief in soul transmigration, Day of the Dead traditions, local legends of "soul wells" (cenotes where the underworld meets the living)

### Tourist Scene
- **Backpacker popularity:** Medium-High (less crowded than Tulum, more "authentic")
- **Type of tourists:** Cultural/spiritual seekers, Chichen Itza visitors, cenote divers
- **Danger level:** Safe (per guidebooks - no one mentions the soul trade)

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Church bells, roosters, vendors setting up
- Afternoon: Silence during siesta, buzz of insects, distant thunder
- Night: Ceremonial drums from somewhere (the hostel says it's the neighbors), whispered Spanish
- Unique sounds: The well in the courtyard sometimes echoes with voices - "acoustics," Don Aurelio explains

### Smells
- Hostel: Copal incense, tropical flowers, bleach (they're very clean)
- Street: Sopa de lima, diesel from colectivos, petrichor
- Specific to death location: Medical antiseptic under lavender oil, decay that no one acknowledges

### Textures
- Surfaces: Rough stucco walls, smooth limestone floors, woven hammocks
- Climate feel: Oppressive humidity that breaks with evening rain

### Tastes
- Local food: Cochinita pibil, papadzules, marquesitas (street crepes)
- Hostel offerings: Complimentary breakfast includes "clarity tea" (mild sedative for new arrivals)

### Visual Details
- Colors: Mustard yellow walls, bright pink bougainvillea, terra cotta, obsidian black accents
- Light quality: Harsh midday sun, golden magic hour, candlelit evenings
- Distinctive visuals: Mirrors everywhere. Every hallway, every room. "For light," they say.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Marco (Don Aurelio's grandson)
**Description:** Early 30s, classically handsome, speaks perfect English with a slight accent. Yoga instructor certification displayed. Eyes that are too old for his face - because he's been in three different bodies since birth.
**Role in death:** Primary recruiter. Identifies suitable candidates through conversation. Reports their health status to Don Aurelio.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Guadalupe | Only local hire - doesn't speak to guests, crosses herself constantly |
| Security | Tomas | Handles "transitions," never smiles, ex-military bearing |
| Kitchen | Rosario | Prepares all ceremonial meals, specialist in herbal preparations |
| Manager | Don Aurelio | The ritualist himself, appears elderly but moves wrong |

### Staff Knowledge
All family members know and participate. Guadalupe knows but won't speak of it. The ritual has kept their family alive across generations - many of them are much older than they appear, having swapped into younger bodies when theirs failed.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Peaceful, spiritual, welcoming. Yoga classes in the courtyard. Cenote trips. Cultural tours. Everything designed to make guests lower their defenses and open up about their health, their lives, whether anyone would miss them.

### Night Vibe
Quieter than expected. Guests report unusually deep sleep. Some say they hear chanting, see figures in the mirrors. Morning always seems to come too fast.

### Guest Demographics
Solo female travelers seeking transformation (primary targets). Elderly guests "spending their final days somewhere beautiful." Couples who never seem to leave together.

### Reputation
TripAdvisor reviews are glowing but generic. Negative reviews disappear quickly. Reddit threads call it "life-changing" without specifics. The few who suspect something are dismissed as trolls.

## Practical Details

### Getting There
- ADO bus from Cancun or Merida
- The hostel sends Marco to "help with luggage" - actually to assess new arrivals

### Check-in Process
Extensive intake form including emergency contacts ("so we can notify them of your transformative experience"), blood type (for "mosquito preparation"), and next of kin (filed but never used as listed)

### Rules
- No photography in the basement
- Mirror circles must not be broken
- Guests are encouraged to attend at least one ceremony (but never required - consent matters)
- The well is off-limits

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: excellent - they monitor all communications)
- [x] Kitchen
- [x] Lockers (biometric - they save the data)
- [x] Laundry
- [ ] Pool
- [x] Bar (extensive mezcal selection, some bottles very old)
- [x] Rooftop
- [x] Tours offered (cenote visits, ruins, "soul journeys")
- [x] Other: Daily ceremonies, "transformation packages"

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Valladolid's layout and culture should be accurate
- Cenote geography and mythology is real
- Mayan underworld beliefs (Xibalba) are genuine
- Day of the Dead practices should be respectful

### Cultural Sensitivity
- The ritual is fictional and should not be attributed to real Mayan practices
- The family is portrayed as outside mainstream culture, not representative of it
- Local characters who refuse to participate should be shown as the sensible ones

### Sources
- Yucatan travel guides
- Academic papers on Mayan death beliefs
- Walking tours of Valladolid
- Hostel architecture research
